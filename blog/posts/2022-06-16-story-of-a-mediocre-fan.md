Title: Story of a mediocre fan

The winter before I moved to Sweden (2009-2010), Arsenal launched Arsenal
Player, and gave Red members access to watch all matches online the next day.
This included not only Premier League matches, but also League Cup, FA Cup, and
Champion's League (remember that?) matches. This was the trigger for me to sign
up, and I've remained a Red member since. This also was the beginning of my deep
dive into Arsenal fandom. I subscribed to all of the Arsenal blogs I could find,
one of which was called [7amkickoff](https://7amkickoff.com/), because it was
written by this Arsenal fan from the west coast US who often had to get up at
absurd hours to watch Arsenal.

Like many US sports fans, Tim is really into stats. Unlike many US sports fans,
he actually knows what he's talking about, and he's a damned good writer. Over
the years, we've become friends on Twitter, and a few years back, he graciously
offered to post some of my work if I even got around to writing about Arsenal.
Well, I finally got around to it, and Tim posted the first part of a story I
wrote about how I became and Arsenal fan.
