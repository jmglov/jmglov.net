So far this summer, most of the stuff I’ve written has turned out to be stories
from my childhood, even when that was perhaps not my intention when I started
typing. [Yesterday’s post](2022-06-17-creating-a-blog-with-clojure.html) broke
the mold a bit, of course, but today I want to smash it!

Let me start off by telling a story from my childhood (d’oh!) to set things up.
In 7th grade, I started middle school. In Staunton, where I was living at the
time, we had three elementary schools, but just one middle school. So you’d be
cruising along from kindergarten through 6th grade, hanging with the friends
from your extended neighbourhood that you’d known for years — with an occasional
The New Kid thrown in from time to time (I got to be The New Kid midway through
5th grade) — when all of a sudden you were dumped into 7th grade at Shelburne
Middle School with all these people from the other two elementary schools that
you probably didn’t know unless you played Little League baseball or something
(in Little League, when you signed up, they just dumped you in a random team, so
you wouldn’t necessarily be with your best friends).

One of these randos who was dumped into Shelburne along with me was this dude
named Adam Steele. Unlike my best friend Ryan, who was into classical music,
video games, and touch football (the US kind of football, not soccer football);
or my best friend Ian, who was into shoes, video games, and BB guns; Adam was
into Dungeons & Dragons and books and girls (he was a good-looking popular kid).
Like many best friends, Adam and I were enemies before we were friends (I had
another best friend like this, but that’s a really sad story that I’m honestly
not sure I’m up to telling).

You see, in our social studies class, we were learning about the US legal system
(but not the part about it where it disproportionately convicts Black and brown
folks, ‘cuz that would be a little too real for 7th grade, apparently), and to
do this, the teacher set up a mock trial where Goldilocks was being charged with
breaking and entering. Adam was the prosecutor, I was Baby Bear (star witness
for the prosecution, doncha know), and Goldilocks was this girl named Laura that
I had a huuuuuuge crush on my entire middle school and high school career (but
of course didn’t do anything about, because I didn’t know how to indicate to her
that I thought she was the best and I really liked her and I’d love to get some
ice cream or watch a movie or go roller skating or whatever together — wow, it
sounds so easy in retrospect).

When Adam called me as a witness, I followed along with his questions according
to the outline he’d prepared and coached me on, giving all the right answers.
Things were looking pretty grim for Goldilocks, until her defence attorney
stepped up for the cross examination and plot twist! I folded under questioning
and revealed that Goldilocks was a friend of mine and I had invited her over and
forgotten to tell my parents and the whole thing was just a terrible
misunderstanding. As you can imagine, a jury of Goldilocks’s peers found her not
guilty, she went free, and Adam absolutely **hated** me for the next several
months.

I don’t remember what it was that diminished his hatred to the point where we
started talking to each other civilly at school, but we eventually became
friends and started hanging out, and he introduced me to D&D and fantasy novels
(up to that point, I was unaware that fantasy was a genre, and thought that “The
Hobbit” and the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy were the only books like that, so I
would read “The Hobbit”, then all three “Lord of the Rings” books, then when I
finished “Return of the King”, I’d start over with “The Hobbit” again). Adam was
my first Dungeon Master (no, not like that, you pervs), and spun amazing tales
of adventure — which often ended in the gruesome death of my character — that
got the blood pumping and the mind soaring. He was, in short, an incredible
storyteller and one of the most creative people I’d met so far in my young life.

The two of us were in the same English class, and we would try and outdo each
other with our writing assignments: his sardonic wit and gift with words against
my homespun charm and odd humour. Honestly, it was one of those contests where
we were both winners, because we sharpened our craft and entertained our
classmates. Some people in the classroom would actually pump their fist when the
teacher called one of us up to the front to read our latest, and I swear to god
that we even got applause a time or two.

And then we came to the poetry unit. Adam hated poetry. I don’t remember why,
but he always rolled his eyes at every poem the teacher read out loud, and
claimed it was writing in the same way that modern art was art: not at all. My
mom was an English teacher, however, and she had instilled a love of poetry in
me years ago, so I was really enjoying the unit, and in our very first poetry
writing assigment, I wrote the first in a long series of poems in a new form I
had invented: Spastic Poetry.

When I was 12 years old in the United States, I didn’t know the word “spastic”
was used in the UK as a hurtful pejorative term for people with mental
disabilities. In the US, we used it more like “absurdly off the wall” or
something like that. In any case, I now know that the word is extremely ableist,
so I have now renamed my form Aberrant Poetry, because I think that captures the
spirit of the original.

So here, my dear readers, is an sample of Aberrant Poetry, the first I’ve
attempted in at least 25 years. Forgive me if I’m a bit rusty.

## Aberrant Toads

*Of snails and frogs and aberrant toads*  
*When I drive, I use the roads*  
*Otherwise, my axel would break*  
*And I’d have to replace it with a rake*  
*And that would cause my car to stall*  
*And likely run into a wall*  
*Or perhaps into a field*  
*Where an inventory of the creatures therein would yield*  
*Snails and frogs and aberrent toads*  
*And sorcerers and mages of many modes*  
*Necromancers and wizards with funky robes*  
*Summoning up demons with names like Wobbes*  
*Who’d consume my car with hellish breath*  
*Like they were high on crystal meth*  
*Sold to them by Walter White*  
*Or some other aberrant knight*  
*Riding a horse of midnight black*  
*Stopping by 7–11 for a snack*  
*Perhaps a hot dog or even nachos*  
*Like Randy Savage of the men of machos*  
*Leaping down from the ring’s top rope*  
*To land a supplex on some poor mope*  
*But back to fields of verdant green*  
*Wherein my car with cracked windscreen*  
*Lay upside down, with spinning wheels*  
*While my nasty bruise it heals*  
*Upon the car, amongst other things*  
*A little bird forlornly sings*  
*Of snails and frogs and aberrant toads*
