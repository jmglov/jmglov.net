I finished up chapter 2 of "[Story of a mediocre
fan](https://7amkickoff.com/index.php/2022/06/23/story-of-a-mediocre-fan-chapter-2/)"
yesterday, but wasn't 100% sure that Tim was planning to post it today, so I
figured that I'd better write a piece for today just in case, because it would
be terrible to break my streak on a technicality. I took a look at [the old todo
list](http://jmglov.net/blog/2022-06-21-todo-list.html), and saw that I intended
to enable HTTPS for my blog, so I might as well write about that, in my now
legendary "50 simple steps" format (I wanted to link to the "50 simple steps"
entries in my archive, but I dunno if the static site generator I'm using
supports that, and I'm short on time for reasons that shall become evident
tomorrow, so I won't
[UtSL](https://twitter.com/vanweringh/status/434264706988011520/photo/1) at the
moment--damn, another entry for the todo list!), but then when I reached step
50, I saw that Tim had just tweeted out the link to chapter 2 on his blog, so I
abandoned all hope ye who here enter on the HTTPS stuff and wrote this little
post instead so that I can link to the piece that counts as my writing for the
day but was actually written over the past week or so (shh, don't tell anyone!).

The link, by the way, is in the first sentence, so click it and stop reading
this silliness before the end of this sentence which I will end soon but I want
to give you a little time to click the link before I reach the end of the
sentence which is ending in 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... NOW!!!
