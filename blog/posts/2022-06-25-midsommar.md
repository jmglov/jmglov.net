Midsommar in Sweden means four things:
1. Buggering off to your country house
2. [Making crowns of flowers and dancing around a
   maypole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsummer#Sweden)
3. Singing drinking songs and getting absolutely hammered on
   [aquavit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akvavit)
4. Taking off from work until mid-August

I did none of those things yesterday, iconoclast that I am. Instead, I slept off
a slight hangover that I incurred the night before whilst hanging out with the
Duskstalkers (one of my old teams at work) and celebrating Kim's new job (Staff
Engineer, well done Kim-tacular!) and impending birthday. After rolling out of
bed around 9:00, I took Rover out for his morning walk and then had a light
breakfast whilst losing a few games of [Dominion
online](https://dominion.games/), then did some light housework, and rewarded
myself by plopping down in front of my son's computer and playing about 4 hours
of Civ V!

At some point, my mate Simon (of Guitar Hero fame) texted to invite me over to
his place for dinner, so Rover and I buggered off over there (not a country
house, sadly) to enjoy not making crowns of flowers and dancing around a maypole
but instead making a barbeque with Simon, and getting absolutely hammered on
prosecco (not aquavit) whilst listening to Spotify. So we had a lovely evening,
despite failing at midsommar-hood. I am taking off from work until September,
though, so I guess I won't have my Swedish passport revoked for nonconformity.

Simon and his partner Pippa are tremendous fun and really smart people who have
informed opinions on pretty much any topic, so it's always fun to have a few
drinks with them and solve the world's problems. The only downside is that we
don't necessarily remember all the solutions the next day, and I guess most of
the solutions depend on people consulting us before doing things, which
tragically I've been unable to convince people to do, even though obviously my
superior judgement would have helped us as a species avoid the various sticky
situations we now find ourselves in.

Since there was no designated driver on hand, Rover and I spent the night, then
had a nice late breakfast and a dip in Lake MÃ¤laren before coming home. And now
here I sit, sharing my non-traditional yet lovely midsommar evening with all of
you.

Now it's time to either finally [get HTTPS working on my
blog](2022-06-24-s3-https.html) or maybe just play some Civ V (I'm playing as
Thailand, and having just taught the Mongols and the Germans some good manners,
I'm swallowing hard as the Koreans and Ottomans have turned on me and unleashed
a huge expeditionary force).
