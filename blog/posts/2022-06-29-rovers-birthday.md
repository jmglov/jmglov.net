Yesterday was a very special day for the best boy in the whole wide world: my
dog Rover turned 9! We celebrated with the following lovely "cake", which I made
by frosting half of a hamburger bun with liver pâté (the cheap supermarket kind,
don't worry) and spelling out his age in doggy treats, since I don't think he
knows how to blow out a candle and is afraid of fire, as any sensible dog should
be.

He also received a brand new to us gently used tennis ball that Joanna and I
found the other day when retrieving a ball that I somehow managed to smack onto
the overhead walkway at the tennis court where we were playing Monday morning.

As a (mostly) Labrador Retriever, Rover's love of tennis balls is the stuff of
Shakespeare sonnets.

*Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?*  
*Thou art more greenish-yellow and more squishy.*  
*Rough winds do make it hard to catch you,*  
*And summer’s leash hath all too short a length.*  
*Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,*  
*Which makes me pant after several goes;*  
*And every throw from fair sometime declines,*  
*By chance, or Josh's dodgy aim, untrimmed;*  
*But thy eternal bounce shall not fade,*  
*Nor lose possession of that fuzz thou ow’st,*  
*Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,*  
*When split thou seams become'st.*  
*So long as dogs can chase, or eyes can see,*  
*So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.*
