Title: Story of a mediocre fan: chapter 3
Tags: arsenal,stories
Date: 2022-06-30

It's Thursday in Stockholm, and I have some good news and some bad news for you,
which I shall interleave in the following several bullet points:
- Good news: as [the damned Norwegians
  promised](2022-06-28-hotter-than-hellsinki.html), yesterday was cloudy and
  cooler than at the beginning of the week, peaking at around 24 degrees in the
  early evening.
- Bad news: the peak temperature yesterday coincided with Simon and I tucking
  into some really spicy curry and then starting an epic Guitar Hero session, so
  it felt like about a gazillion degrees in my apartment.
- Badder news: it's back to being sunny and hot now, and worse yet, when I look
  back at my screenshot of [the Norwegians'
  forecast](assets/2022-06-28-stockholm-helsinki.png), I actually see that they
  predicted this, so now I have to apologise for calling them liars. Sorry, you
  damned smug Norwegians, sitting atop your pile of filthy oil-generated lucre!
- Good news: I wrote the 3000-4000 words required for [chapter 3 of "Story of a
  mediocre
  fan"](https://7amkickoff.com/index.php/2022/06/30/story-of-a-mediocre-fan-chapter-3/).
- Bad news: I wrote nearly 5000 words in chapter 3, which is a bit longer than
  spec. Tim graciously told me that since he's verbose, he has no right to ask
  me not to be. I think he does actually have the right, since it's his blog,
  but I didn't want to argue with him on this point. ;)
- Good news: my friend, former coworker, and best Product person in the world
  Sajal is in town, and we're going out with our former boss Rafa to celebrate
  Sajal's new job!
- Bad news: the bus that I need to catch to be on time to meet the boys down on
  SÃ¶dermalm is in less than 40 minutes, and I haven't gotten in the shower yet
  because I'm sitting here writing this!
- Badder news: my mean friend Ray (not to be confused with my mean friend
  Sen--maybe I need to get nicer friends!) will probably claim that this entry
  is "phoning it in", the jackass! I don't see him blogging daily, only
  complaining about the poor quality of my daily blog (which, to be honest, he
  kinda has a point about, but I'm following [my friend Juan's
  advice](2022-06-15-summertime.html) and being brave enough to be awful until
  I'm not).
- Good news: I'm done phoning it in now, so you can stop reading this drivel and
  head on over to [7amkickoff](https://7amkickoff.com/) to read my actual daily
  writing!
