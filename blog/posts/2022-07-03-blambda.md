A couple of weeks ago, I made a [todo list](2022-06-21-todo-list.html) for the
summer. One of the items on there was to create an AWS Lambda custom runtime for
[Babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka). I actually accomplished that a
few days later, and today I want to walk through the what, the why, and the how
of that project.

Let's start by answering the question of what a custom runtime is. For anyone
not familiar with [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), it is basically
a way to run a function in the AWS cloud without having to worry about how or
where the function is actually executed. For me, cloud functions are the next
natural step along the path of computing without caring about machines. First
came servers that you had to host yourself, then came VMs that you could run on
servers you hosted yourself, then came EC2, which gave you a VM hosted by
somebody else, then came containers, then came managed container environments
like Kubernetes, then came function as a service, which allowed you to provide a
zip file that just ran somewhere. You can nitpick the order if you want, but
this is more or less accurate. I'm also not claiming that serverless is right
for all workloads, but when it is, it's pretty great.

So having explained what Lambda is, I'll crack on with explaining custom
runtimes. Lambda comes out of the box with runtimes that support a great variety
of programming languages: Python, Golang, .Net, Ruby, JavaScript, and Java.
Those last two are of interest to Clojure programmers, since they allow us to
write ClojureScript functions and execute them on the NodeJS runtime, or Clojure
proper on the Java runtime (you could technically also execute Clojure programs
on the .Net runtime using [Clojure CLR](https://clojure.org/about/clojureclr),
but I doubt many people are doing that). This is great, unless you need
predictably low-ish latency, because the first time you invoke a lambda
function, AWS need to spin up an execution environment, then execute your
function. This is called a "cold start", and for the JVM, it can take a few
thousand milliseconds, and that's **before** starting the Clojure runtime, which
can take a few thousand more.

Clojure programmers have long known about this JVM startup delay, of course,
which is why we tend not to write command line utilities in Clojure, since it is
quite annoying for your utility to take 2-3 seconds just to tell you that you've
misspelled one of the options (was it `--dry-run` or `--dryrun`?). And of course
we've had ways around that for awhile as well, mostly based on ClojureScript
([Lumo](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo) is one example). So one could write
lambdas in ClojureScript and run them on the NodeJS runtime and not have to wait
around for the JVM to start up (the NodeJS runtime has a cold start of a few
hundred milliseconds instead of a few **thousand** for the JVM), though there
are a few drawbacks with that as well:

1. In order for the NodeJS runtime to execute ClojureScript, it needs to be
   transpiled to JavaScript, which means you can't edit it in the lambda
   console, which makes troubleshooting those annoying problems that only seem
   to happen when you deploy the thing harder, since you have to add your
   `println` statements locally and then compile and then upload and then try
   again and then realise you need another `println` somewhere else... ugh! To
   be fair, JVM Clojure has the same issue.
2. You have to use NodeJS. Yuck.

Luckily, AWS has provided the ability to specify a [custom
runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html),
which can be written in any language and just needs to be executable on a Linux
system and implement a simple local invocation API. This means that you can now
write lambda functions in any language!

Getting back to Clojure, the wonderful [borkdude](https://github.com/borkdude)
realised that if one could compile a Clojure program using
[GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/), it would start up fast, thus enabling
command line programs in Clojure that didn't make you want to pull your hair
out. "But why stop there?" borkdude presumably thought to himself. "Writing
shell scripts in Bash kinda sucks, so what about writing them in Clojure
instead? All I'd have to do is write a program that can interpret Clojure and
compile it with GraalVM and then it could execute Clojure scripts or Clojure
code passed on the command line and then my life would be complete." And this
magical program, my friends, is called Babashka.

Since Babashka starts fast and can evaluate Clojure source code, we can build a
custom runtime for Lambda that uses Babashka to execute our lambda functions,
thus gaining the ability to edit source code in the lambda console **and** use
Clojure instead of ClojureScript, both of which are very important to me.

This was the motivation behind building
[Blambda!](https://github.com/jmglov/blambda), which is a custom runtime that
can be deployed as a [Lambda
layer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-concepts.html#gettingstarted-concepts-layer).
Let's talk about how it works.

A custom runtime requires only one thing: an executable named `bootstrap` in the
root level of your lambda function's archive. When your function is invoked for
the first time, the Lambda runtime executes the `bootstrap` function, which is
then expected to call Lambda's [next invocation
API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-api.html#runtimes-api-next),
which returns the request body of whatever called your lambda function, which
the runtime customarily hands off to the actual code implementing your lambda
function and then feeds the return value of that to the Lambda [invocation
response
API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-api.html#runtimes-api-response),
and then waits for the next request and does the same thing all over again.

In the case of Blambda!, the custom runtime consists of three parts:
- The statically linked Babashka executable itself
- A Clojure program,
  [`bootstrap.clj`](https://github.com/jmglov/blambda/blob/f1ab0ecd79e7b9d1ff733927baf68a9551e42d6b/bootstrap.clj),
  that implements the request handling loop described above. I borrowed this
  from an existing Babashka runtime,
  [bb-lambda](https://github.com/tatut/bb-lambda), which I decided not to use
  because it uses Docker, which makes me almost as sad as NodeJS. ;)
- A
  [`bootstrap`](https://github.com/jmglov/blambda/blob/f1ab0ecd79e7b9d1ff733927baf68a9551e42d6b/bootstrap)
  shell script which uses Babashka to evaluate the above Clojure program

Packaging this as a layer is as simple as downloading Babashka, then zipping it
into an archive with the other two files, which you can see in the `build` task
of Blambda!'s [`bb.edn`](https://github.com/jmglov/blambda/blob/39519beeae0296508517f292df6de8f5df563dd7/bb.edn#L17).

To use Blambda!, you can build and deploy the custom runtime layer by cloning
the repo and running:

```
bb deploy
```

You then create a lambda function that uses the "provided" runtime, includes
the "blambda" layer that was created by the `bb deploy` command, and sets the
handler to whatever function in your namespace that will handle function
invocations. For example, if you have a namespace like this:

``` clojure
(ns hello)

(defn hello [{:keys [name] :or {name "Blambda"} :as event} context]
  (prn {:msg "Invoked with event",
        :data {:event event}})
  {:greeting (str "Hello " name "!")})
```

you can create a lambda function like this:

![AWS Lambda console create function page showing the setting of runtime to
'provide your own bootstrap on Amazon Linux 2'](assets/2022-07-03-blambda-create-function.png)

![AWS Lambda console add layer page showing selecting a custom layer named 'blambda'](assets/2022-07-03-blambda-add-layer.png)

![AWS Lambda console edit runtime settings page showing setting the handler to 'hello/hello'](assets/2022-07-03-blambda-set-handler.png)

and then test it with an event like this:

``` json
{
  "name": "jmglov"
}
```

The Lambda console will display something like this:

```
Test Event Name
hello

Response
{
  "greeting": "Hello jmglov!"
}

Stay tuned for future posts on Blambda! when I try to actually use it for
something real. ;)
