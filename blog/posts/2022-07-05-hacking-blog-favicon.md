Title: Hacking the blog: favicon

The fun thing about having a blog which is built with a [static site
generator](https://github.com/jmglov/jmglov.net) is that you get to ~~waste~~
spend time customising it. In today's instalment of "Hacking the blog", we'll
see how to add a "[favicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon)", which is
that little icon thingy on your tab title.

My first order of business was to figure out what I wanted to use for my
favicon. I decided that I really love this drawing that my friend Sebastian did
on a whiteboard way back in 2016, so why not use it?

## Building the favicon

The first step (after I remembered what a "favicon" was actually called) was
making a clean version of this image that would scale down nicely to the various
sizes used by browsers. Courtesy of [a really thorough
answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19590415/58994) to a question on Stack
Overflow, I found a really cool site called
[RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/), which would take an
image (recommended to be at least 260x206 pixels) and spit out a zipfile
containing a bunch of files:
- android-chrome-192x192.png
- android-chrome-256x256.png
- apple-touch-icon.png
- browserconfig.xml
- favicon-16x16.png
- favicon-32x32.png
- favicon.ico
- mstile-150x150.png
- safari-pinned-tab.svg
- site.webmanifest

These files, if placed at the root of your website and combined with a chunk of
HTML in your `<head>` section, would do the right thing for All the Browsers and
All the Smartphones.

So I opened up my image in [the GIMP](https://gimp.org/), cropped it so only my
head was visible, and removed the speech bubble, resulting in the following:

I fed this image into RealFaviconGenerator, which gave me back the zipfile
described above and the following HTML fragment:

``` html
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/apple-touch-icon.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/favicon-32x32.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="/favicon-16x16.png">
<link rel="manifest" href="/site.webmanifest">
<link rel="mask-icon" href="/safari-pinned-tab.svg" color="#5bbad5">
<meta name="msapplication-TileColor" content="#da532c">
<meta name="theme-color" content="#ffffff">
```

## Hacking the blog

The next order of business was to get the favicon onto my site. If you remember
from the [Actually blogging with
Clojure](2022-06-19-actually-blogging-with-clojure.html) post, the way the blog
works is this:
1. There's a [Babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka)
   [`bb.edn`](https://github.com/jmglov/jmglov.net/blob/main/blog/bb.edn) which
   defines a `render` task that looks like this:
   ``` clojure
render {:doc "Render blog"
        :task (load-file "render.clj")}
   ```
2. [`render.clj`](https://github.com/jmglov/jmglov.net/blob/main/blog/render.clj)
   does stuff like converting Markdown to HTML, then uses the
   [Selmer](https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer) templating system to shove blog
   posts into the
   [`templates/base.html`](https://github.com/jmglov/jmglov.net/blob/main/blog/templates/base.html)
   template
3. `render.clj` then copies the resulting HTML files to a `public/` directory
4. There's another task called `publish` in `bb.edn` that uses the AWS CLI to
   sync everything in the `public/` to the S3 bucket that contains my blog:
   ``` clojure
publish {:doc "Publish to jmglov.net"
         :depends [render]
         :task (shell "aws s3 sync --delete public/ s3://jmglov.net/blog/")}
   ```

So getting the favicon injected into every page was as simple as blasting the
HTML fragment into `templates/base.html`.

Almost.

You see, I also need to put the content being referenced in all of those
`<link>` tags up on the website. My website itself uses the exact same machinery
as the blog, meaning I need to add the HTML fragment to the top-level
[`templates/base.html`](https://github.com/jmglov/jmglov.net/blob/main/templates/base.html),
and in order to get the favicon stuff onto the website, I need to hack up the
top-level
[`render.clj`](https://github.com/jmglov/jmglov.net/blob/main/render.clj).

Looking at the way the existing `render.clj` (which I stole with pride from
[borkdude‚Äôs blog](https://github.com/borkdude/blog)) handles images and CSS is
most instructive:

``` clojure
(def out-dir "public")

;;;; Sync images and CSS

(def asset-dir (fs/create-dirs (fs/file out-dir "assets")))

(fs/copy-tree "assets" asset-dir {:replace-existing true})

(spit (fs/file out-dir "style.css")
      (slurp "templates/style.css"))
```

Since the `deploy` task will sync everything from the `public/` directory to my
website, I just need to put the contents of the favicon zipfile in `public/` and
I win!

I unzipped the favicon zipfile into a top-level
[`favicon/`](https://github.com/jmglov/jmglov.net/tree/main/favicon) directory,
then added the following to `render.clj`:

``` clojure
;;;; Sync favicon

(def favicon-dir (fs/create-dirs (fs/file out-dir)))

(fs/copy-tree "favicon" favicon-dir {:replace-existing true})
```

And that's all it took to display my little cartoon face on your browser's tab!
