Title: A quick check-in

I started the day off with a nice game of tennis with my friend Joanna, then sat
down at my desk and reworked the final chapter of "[Story of a mediocre
fan](2022-06-16-story-of-a-mediocre-fan.html)", which should go out tomorrow.
I'm not entirely happy with my execution, but I learned a lot in writing it, and
uncovered a lot of lovely memories that were buried somewhere in the drafty
attic that is my brain.

I also watched the Spain-Finland match in the Women's Euro 2022, which was a
really good game, thanks to massive underdogs Finland scoring in the second
minute and then refusing to quit against a hugely talented Spain side. I'm
watching the end of the first half of Germany-Denmark right now. I want to write
a longer post about women's football, because as much as I'm enjoying this
tournament, I'm not enjoying some of the nonsense on Twitter. For some reason, a
certain sort of man has to either make stupid sexist jokes or talk about how his
son's under 7 team could beat any of these teams, instead of just not watching
the football if that's not his thing.

But that's a subject for another day, when I'm not tired and cranky. For now,
I'm going to post this, then go find myself a beer and watch the second half.
