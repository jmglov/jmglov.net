Today's main story is that the final chapter of "[Story of a mediocre
fan](https://7amkickoff.com/index.php/2022/07/09/story-of-a-mediocre-fan-chapter-4/)"
has been published over on 7amkickoff! Four weeks, 18,383 words, countless
lessons about writing learned. I'm so grateful to Tim from 7amkickoff for giving
me the opportunity to write something that lots of Arsenal fans will see! ðŸ’œ

The other news of the day is that I finally got Civilization V working on my
laptop! You can read the coda to [Installing Steam on NixOS in 50 simple
steps](2022-06-20-installing-steam-on-nixos.html) if you want the details, or
you can just bask in this glorious screenshot with me:

Lovely!

I also had some [ÑˆÐºÐµÐ¼Ð±Ðµ
Ñ‡Ð¾Ñ€Ð±Ð°](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripe_soup#Middle_East_and_Southeastern_Europe)
for lunch, which is a Bulgarian tripe soup that probably comes from Turkey
(where it's called iÅŸkembe Ã§orbasÄ±, according to [Bulgarian
Wikipedia](https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A8%D0%BA%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B1%D0%B5_%D1%87%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B0))
via the Ottoman Empire. Spicy and delicious!

Tonight is the first big match of the Women's Euro 2022 for me tonight, as
Sweden and the Netherlands play, pitting Arsenal striker [Stina
Blackstenius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stina_Blackstenius) against
Arsenal striker converted to number 10 [Vivianne Miedema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivianne_Miedema)
and former Arsenal midfielder [DaniÃ«lle van de
Donk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani%C3%ABlle_van_de_Donk). Since each team
has one current Arsenal player, by my rules, I should cheer for the Netherlands,
since they also have a former Arsenal player, but rules be damned, I'm cheering
for Sweden, because I live here and consider international sports the one
acceptable place for nationalism.

Heja Sverige, and hej dÃ¥ allihop!
