Title: Some stuff I learned today

Today was a highly educational day in which I learned many things. Here is a
non-exhaustive list in roughly chronological order:

1. Getting woken up by the sun pouring through your window is sometimes a good
   thing, like when you have a 09:00 meeting that you've forgotten to set an
   alarm for.
2. Having a dog that you have to walk twice a day is a wonderful thing in the
   summer in Stockholm. It keeps you from spending all day in front of the
   computer. This morning's walk was especially sunny and nice, warm but not
   hot. There's a nice field near my house where I can take Rover off the leash
   if no one is around, and no one was around this morning. A creek runs through
   the middle of the field, and they just mowed along the banks last week, which
   apparently uncovered all sorts of interesting smells that Rover needed to
   spend a good long time investigating. I was strolling along, waiting for him
   to finish sniffing one spot before moving to the next, listening to a
   podcast, and appreciating the moment whilst I was in it. Life isn't always
   great, but sometimes it is, even if only for a few minutes.
3. There was of course a bug in [my caching
   code](2022-07-11-hacking-blog-caching.html), which occurred to me at some
   point along my walk. Several solutions also occurred to me, but they were all
   making the solution more complex and not simpler. I sat down at my computer
   when I got back from the walk, fired up my REPL, and tried to trigger the bug
   I though of. Indeed my darkest fears were realised as I added a new tag to an
   existing post and watched it not re-render. I had another idea that was
   simpler than my existing code, so I started messing around in the REPL until
   I was able to pull the problem apart a bit and see a way through. I'm not
   finished implementing the new idea yet, but when I am, I'll be sure to blog
   about it.
4. I'm not going to make much progress on my reading (trying to finish Asimov's
   "[Second
   Foundation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29580.Second_Foundation)") if
   I don't stop playing Civilization V! I always forget just how long that game
   takes to play. ðŸ˜…
5. I'm really terrible at bowling. Like really really terrible. Which would be
   fine except I occasionally do something not terrible, which puts this
   unreasonable idea in my head that I should not be terrible, thus making my
   inevitable return to terribility (it's a word now!) a crushing
   disappointment.
6. England may have completely ruined the [Women's Euro
   2022](https://www.uefa.com/womenseuro/) for me. I watched Spain play Germany
   tonight, and what should have been an enjoyable watch as two good but very
   different teams went head to head was rendered unwatchable because there
   weren't eight goals and both teams made actual mistakes. To be fair, as an
   Arsenal fan, there was something too familiar about the way Spain dominated
   possession then just passed it around the penalty box without offering any
   real threat. ArsÃ¨ne Wenger called it "sterile domination", and oh my goodness
   have I had enough of it for one lifetime.
7. I really need to start writing my blog in the morning, when I am not super
   tired.
