I've been reading a biography of a recent US political figure. Let's see if you
can guess who it is from these short excerpts from the book.

> The reporters made another misjudgement, brought on their own sense of
> self-importance. [...] The reason the reporters assumed X meant it [...] was
> that he had insulted and attacked the press as he said it. No one could do
> that and survive in American politics, in the opinion of the press. In
> charging that the press was biased, untruthful, and vindictive, X had burned
> his bridges behind him.

> X had just made the press an issue. X knew that the national press did not
> speak for or to millions of Republicans. He understood and enunciated a point
> of view: that the press was liberal, Democratic, do-gooder, pro big government
> and big labour, for high taxes, yet craven in the face of the [enemy's]
> menace, and always out to give the shaft to Republicans.

> X pointed out another advantage of the last press conference. "It served a
> purpose," he said. "The press had a guilt complex about their inaccuracy."
> (this was an assertion, not a fact, and every reporter [...] would have denied
> it)...

> ...although what he said delighted most Republicans, it made the Democrats
> hate him even more, which pointed to his more general problem, that he was the
> most hated and feared man in America. No one could rouse the Democrats for an
> all-out effort quite the way X could; thus [...] the fervour and dedication of
> the anti-X volunteers in the Y campaign. This was a consequence of X's
> campaign style, in which he nearly always exaggerated...

> X wanted to be powerful. To get power, he had to remain a public figure,
> speaking out on the issues of the day.

> He used a favourite X technique--to deny that he was saying what he was
> saying--and got some revenge in the process.

> X was pleased with his effort. He told his backers that "it served the purpose
> of setting forth some constructive alternatives to present Administration
> policy." Of course the opposite was true--the alternatives he had offered were
> jingoistic and irresponsible and inconsistent. [...] But there was one good
> thing about being in opposition: it freed X to slash and denounce without
> having to assume any responsibility for his words.

> The way the press had fawned on [his predecessor] had made X furious and
> jealous; [...] the things [his predecessor] had gotten away with had made X
> resentful.

It's pretty easy to guess, right? Reply to me on [this
thread](https://twitter.com/jmglov/status/1551201401014976514) if you know who
it is. I'll update this post tomorrow with a link to the correct answer.
