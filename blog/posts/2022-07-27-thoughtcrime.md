We're staying in a one-room apartment in Spain for vacation, so we've been
switching on the news in the morning whilst eating breakfast. The news has been
absolutely chock full of wildfires and droughts and heat warnings and this
morning, torrential rains in St. Louis that caused flash floods. So yeah, signs
of the Apocalypse that is climate change, met with the usual indifference in the
corridors of power. Boring.

Something out of the ordinary that caught my eye was that [according to UK
charity National Energy Action](https://www.nea.org.uk/who-we-are/about-nea/)
rampant inflation, coupled with surging energy prices, could mean that 33% of UK
households could be in fuel poverty this winter:

> From October National Energy Action predicts 8.2 million UK households could
> be in fuel poverty – that’s one in three. It comes after Cornwall Insight
> predicted the average annual energy bill could reach £3,250 – that’s £270 a
> month. Currently, around 6.5 million UK households are in the grip of fuel
> poverty, unable to afford to heat their homes to the temperature needed to
> keep warm and healthy.

The solutions being talked about in the news are the usual ones: capping energy
prices (a good start) and/or subsidies to the poorest households to help them
afford to heat their homes.

Of course it's completely beyond the pale to suggest an actual solution to the
problem: return control of energy generation and distribution and provide energy
at cost. Or even below cost, subsidised by taxes. Or even for free, as a basic
human right.

Reagan and Thatcher and Clinton and Milton Friedman and company all assured us
that deregulating the energy market and privatising public power would lead to
lower energy prices through the power of competition, but [according to the MIT
Center for Energy and Environmental Policy
Research](https://ceepr.mit.edu/deregulation-market-power-and-prices-evidence-from-the-electricity-sector/),
this has not been the case:

In addition to leading to lower prices, moving energy back into public hands
would mean that the process of moving to renewable energy generation would not
be able to be held hostage by a small number of executives, board members, and
powerful shareholders (often large hedge funds like BlackRock), concerned only
with the profitability of such a move.

When it comes to ensuring that power can afford to heat their homes in the
winter, the approach of giving people money to give to private companies who are
often recording record profits as prices rise is a much less efficient way to
use taxes than providing power as a public good, but of course it has the happy
property of perpetuating the current state of affairs, wherein a small handful
of incredibly wealthy people get wealthier whilst the rest of us slide into food
and energy insecurity.
