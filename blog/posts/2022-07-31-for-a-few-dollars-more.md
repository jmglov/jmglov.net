This is our last day in Málaga, and we took a walk in the foothills of Sierra de
Mijas, the mountain overlooking the little towns along the Costa del Sol south
of Málaga. The vistas were really stunning, with a very Wild West feel to them.

This is for a very good reason, it turns out. We met my friend Pablo in Málaga
the other day for dinner, and he told us that quite a few of the classic Sergio
Leone "spaghetti westerns" were actually shot in Andalucía, not in the southwest
US and Mexico where they're set. Andalucía also served as Dorne and the Red Keep
in Game of Thrones, and Naboo Palace in Star Wars Episode II.

It's been a lovely holiday, with the right mix of relaxation and
[adventure](2022-07-23-comedy-of-errors.html), plus a healthy dose of [Clojure
programming](https://github.com/borkdude/quickblog). It will be nice to return
to Sweden tomorrow for a reunion with Rover, who has been staying with my friend
Simon and his family. As you can see, he's not exactly had it rough there:
