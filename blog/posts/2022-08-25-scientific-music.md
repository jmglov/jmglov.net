Before I get into what I'm actually planning to talk about in this post, allow
me to make a variety of excuses for my long silence here:
1. I've been busy
2. I've been lazy
3. I haven't been able to think of interesting stuff to write about
4. Etc.

And allow me to invalidate these excuses so that you don't have to:

1. Many people are busy and yet manage to do things that they want to do. Hmm,
   maybe this is something I should write about in the coming days.
2. "Laziness" is in the eye of the beholder, and is quite often one of the holy
   words of the Cult of Productivity rather than an actual real thing that is
   really real. Hmm, maybe this is something I should write about in the coming
   days.
3. When has "interesting" ever been a prerequisite for my writing? I am very
   fond of the sound of my own voice, so I should just hold forth on any topic
   that enters my mind, secure in the knowledge that I have one guaranteed
   reader: me. Also, it seems like I have a few ideas on what to write about
   (see points 1 and 2 above).
4. This is the only compelling excuse I see. Touché!

OK, with all of that out of the way, I'll get onto the main story:

I have a friend from work (and the Clojure community) named Suvrat, and in
addition to being a good programmer, he's also a good musician. A couple of
months ago, he told me that he'd been a guest musician on this album called [KG
Westman & Zaعfaran](https://open.spotify.com/album/5lNYtd8IocZE2AbRsmM0s6). I
gave it a listen, and it is really cool. It's a mix of Indian and Egyptian
music, using traditional instruments but modern composition, and the result is
this atmospheric, haunting sound that I just can't get enough of (in fact, just
talking about it made me want to listen to it, so it's now playing in the
background as I write this). I really recommend checking this out. Go on, I'll
wait.

Pretty awesome, right? I told you it would be. 😉

So anyway, back to Suvrat. He messaged me a few days ago and told me that he was
playing with KG Westman at this cool café / cider (and maybe beer too?) brewery
/ farm called [Rosenhill](https://rosenhill.nu/index.php/info-in-english/) in
nearby Ekerö at their annual Indian evening on August 24th. I told him that I
would be there, and as a well-known man of my word (actually, I'm a well-known
liar, so that bit about me being a well-known man of my word was a lie--as far
as you know, anyway), my wife and I went out there last night.

We had some delicious Indian food (fried tofu with fresh vegetables from the
farm and some sort of delicious sauce) with Suvrat and a couple of the
musicians, who were kind enough to explain what we were about to hear: [Indian
classical music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_classical_music). Indian
classical music is a rule-based improvisational form built on a melodic
framework called a [raga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raga) and a time
measuring system called a [tala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tala_(music)),
and is played by a small ensemble of musicians with melodic and rhythmic
instruments.

![Four musicians sit on the floor in traditional Indian dress, performing music][musicians]

In our case, the ensemble was two
[sitars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitar) (a stringed instrument with
between 18 and 21 strings that somewhat resembles a lute), a
[santoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santoor) (an instrument which has 138
strings and is played on your lap using two small wooden mallets), and Suvrat
himself on [tabla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabla) (a pair of hand drums).

According to Suvrat, this form of music isn't called "classical music" in India,
but rather "Shastriya Sangeet" ("scientific music" in English)--in fact, the
rules originate from a text written around 2200 years ago called the "[Nāṭya
Śāstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natya_Shastra)", which translates into
English as "The Science of Performing Arts"--because the rules are based on
math, and the players have to occasionally make mathematical computations in
their heads as they play. According to Suvrat:

> When someone ends one musical sentence, they usually end it with something
> called a [Tihai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tihai) (pronounced: Ti-haa-ee),
> and while creating these tihais, you need to compute a few things. And things
> become more complicated when people "nest" these tihais, tihai in a tihai and
> so on.

Suvrat described a day of study with his teacher in India as playing for 3-4
hours, then having lunch with the teacher, who would explain little mathematical
tricks during lunch that they could use, and then another 3-4 hours of playing
music.

The music starts with the melodic instruments introducing the basic theme, which
will repeat throughout the performance, and also introducing themselves to each
other (since the music is rule-based, anyone can play together without having
previously rehearsed together or even met each other). Suvrat described this as
a "conversation in the language of music," which at first sounded very abstract,
but absolutely made sense when I heard it. Through most of this opening section,
which lasted about 15-20 minutes, one musician played at a time for a period of
between just a few seconds and tens of seconds, like they were making a point,
and then another player would start seamlessly as the first one finished their
thought. At times, two players "spoke" at the same time, trading ideas back and
forth quickly. And sometimes, they literally laughed at each other, which Suvrat
explained to me afterwards was because they were making some silly musical
jokes.

After the opening part, the percussion joined in, slowly at first, and then
getting up to speed. At this point, all of the musicians were playing at the
same time. For me, a first time listener, the music seemed to build organically
without me noticing, and then at some point, I felt like I was enveloped in this
rich tapestry of sound, which was beautiful as a whole, but was also comprised
of many individual glimmering threads that you could follow and appreciate in
their own right. I've never had the sensation of being inside a piece of music
before, almost as if I was somehow participating in what was going on.

It was a really amazing experience. I can't really describe how the music
works---the Wikipedia articles I've been linking have more details--or what it
was like to listen to, so I really encourage you to go to a live performance at
some point if you can.

Or if you can't, listen to this amazing talk from EuroClojure by Srihari
Sriraman called [Making machines that make music](https://youtu.be/ZvSSeuzN_b4),
in which he uses Clojure to teach a computer how to compose Indian classical
music.

Or do both!

PS: Suvrat, if you're reading this, please correct any errors I've made and I'll
update the post. 🙂

PPS: Suvrat did in fact read this and suggest some enhancements! And my friend
Sajal also read it and dropped me a couple of recommendations for other stuff I
might like, based on this post. 💜
