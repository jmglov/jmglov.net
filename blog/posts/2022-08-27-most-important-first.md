Like many people, I have many things I want to do, and many fewer hours
available in which to do the things than would be required to do all the things.
Hence, some prioritising is necessary. I'll handwave over how to do the
prioritising today, because that would be a longer post that would require
research and citations andâ€”surprise surprise!â€”I don't have that kind of time
today. Or rather I should say that I am not willing to allocate that amount of
time to that today. Time can't be made, and we have as much as there is in a
day, so it's all about deciding how to use that time.

Assuming that one has prioritised what one wants to do, the best advice that
I've ever seen on how to actually get it done is this: do the most important
thing first. Not the quickest thing, not the most satisfying thing; the most
important thing. This means that whatever else happens in your day, you are
guaranteed to make at least some progress on the thing you've decided is most
important.

As I am an expert in not following my own advice, I did not do the most
important thing first today, which is why you're getting this dashed off (or
ðŸ“±'d ðŸ“¥, if you wanna be mean about it, Ray) post instead of something more
insightful or thought-provoking.

And now I'm off for a quick run before I go over to a friend's place to play
some Dominion!
