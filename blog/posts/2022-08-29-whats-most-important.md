In the spirit of [doing the most important thing
first](2022-08-27-most-important-first.html), I started my "workday" (I'm on
vacation for one more week, but I have non-recreational things that I want to
do, which I define as "work" relative to the other stuff I'm doing) by creating
a Github repo for this writing project I'm working on with Ray. I've typically
used Google Docs for this sort of thing in the past, so I'm interested to see
how a git-based model will work.

What I'd like to talk about today, however, is how I decided that creating a
repo was the most important thing I wanted to do today. Let's start by
stipulating a few things:
- There are some things I want to do and some things I have to do
- I have a certain number of hours in any given day that I can dedicate to doing
  these things
- It is not possible to do all of these things within the allotted time in any
  given day

Given these constraints, how do I decide how to prioritise these things?

Remember, we're not talking here about how to do the things or even in which
order to do the things (though I've established my position on the order: do the
most important thing first), but just to decide the relative priority of these
things.

Most of the time, we tend to take a rather haphazard approach to prioritising
things, at least in an individual context. Software teams usually have a
somewhat more formal method, though I would argue that these formal methods
are often just a haphazard approach in disguise. 😉 In this post, I'm explicitly
focusing solely on prioritising tasks that have no external dependencies
(meaning that you can't be blocked by waiting for something outside of your
control to happen before you can make progress on the task) and where you have
total freedom to decide on the priority.

Let's look at a few different frameworks for approaching this, using the
following list of tasks as an example:
- Create a Github repo for the aforementioned writing project
- Find out when and where to vote early in the upcoming Swedish elections
- Finish my command-line interface work on
  [quickblog](https://github.com/borkdude/quickblog)
- Write this blog post
- Clean up the kitchen
- Vacuum the apartment
- Evaluate signing up for the hellofresh, which is one of those services that
  delivers you a week's worth of ingredients and recipes for suppers so that you
  can try new things and are freed from the tyranny of choice, at least
  temporarily and for this one limited thing
- Change the crystals in my humidor

## The Eisenhower Matrix

One of the easiest to understand frameworks is the so-called [Eisenhower
Matrix](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/eisenhower-matrix) (also known
as the Urgent-Important Matrix). The idea is that any given task can be either
important or not, and either urgent or not, so you can draw a matrix with four
quadrants like so:

![A matrix with four quadrants: important and urgent in the top left; important but not urgent in the top right; not important but urgent in the bottom right; not important and not urgent in the bottom right][matrix1]

The Eisenhower Matrix is designed to combat the "[mere urgency
effect](https://hub.jhu.edu/2018/05/31/meeting-deadlines-time-management-behaviors/)",
which, according to the paper which named the phenomenon (written by Meng Zhu,
an associate professor of marketing at the Johns Hopkins business school):

> can lead people to work on an unimportant chore instead of a more essential
> one. They do so, not because they have a logical reason—such as judging the
> task easier to complete, wanting an immediate reward, or planning to get the
> chore done before moving on to the more important job—but simply because they
> feel they must beat an illusionary urgency (even when the task's duration is
> shorter than the deadline provided).

In order to use this method, the first thing I do is classify each of my tasks
as important or not and urgent or not:
- Github repo: important because I really want to work on this writing project,
  and urgent because I can't get Ray's input until I've set up the repo.
- Voting info: important because I want to vote early, but not urgent because if
  I don't vote early, I can just go to the polling place on election day itself,
  which is 11 September.
- quickblog CLI: important because I want to add some new features to my blog
  and I can't do that until I finish up this work, but not urgent because I'm
  not blocking anyone but myself.
- Blog post: important because I want to keep up the habit of writing and urgent
  because I want to finish this today.
- Clean kitchen: not important to me because it's not really that bad and I can
  just close my eyes when I walk in there so I'm not bothered by a few dirty
  dishes in the sink, but urgent because if I don't do it before this afternoon,
  the dishwasher won't be done in time for supper.
- Vacuum: not important to me because it's not really that bad and I can just
  close my eyes when I walk around the house so I'm not bothered by a few dust
  bunnies here and there, but urgent because if I don't do it before 9 PM, I'll
  have to wait until tomorrow since we're kindly asked not to vacuum or do
  laundry between 9 PM and 7 AM so as not to potentially disturb people whilst
  they're trying to sleep.
- hellofresh: not important because we are capable of figuring out what to eat
  for supper without it being decided for us, and not urgent because this coupon
  that I have for a discounted trial doesn't have an expiration date.
- Humidor: not important because the cigars in the humidor aren't nice enough
  that I'll notice if they're slightly drier than they should be, and not urgent
  because the humidity is still 66% and the recommended range is 65-75%.

Putting that into the matrix, it looks like this:

![Matrix filled in. Important and urgent: Github repo, blog post; important but not urgent: voting info, quickblog CLI; not important but urgent: clean kitchen, vacuum; not important and not urgent: hellofresh, humidor][matrix2]

And finally, I use the matrix to decide what to do with each task. According to
the framework, I should do the tasks that are in the urgent and important
quadrant, schedule the tasks that are in the important but not urgent quadrant,
delegate the tasks that are in the urgent but not important quadrant, and ignore
the tasks that are neither important nor urgent (these quadrants are usually
labelled do, schedule, delegate, and delete, but I'm not using any fancy
software to manage these tasks, so deletion doesn't really make sense, and the
word "ignore" just gives me a feeling of superiority over these damned tasks
which are not the boss of me!).

![Matrix labeled "do" in the top left; "schedule" in the top right; "delegate"
in the bottom left; and "ignore" in the bottom right][matrix3]

Based on this, I decided to create the Github repo (already done!) and write
this blog post (in progress as I type this but done by the time you read it)
before I turned my attention to any of the other stuff. I arbitrarily decided
that I'd create the repo first because I figured it would take at most five
minutes to do and fill me with a sense of accomplishment which would power my
blogging.

According to the framework, I should schedule the tasks that are important but
not urgent, so I'll decide to do them "later" (either after I finish the urgent
and important stuff or tomorrow if I run out of time today). I should delegate
the urgent but not important tasks, which in my case means asking my son to do
them. Actually, emptying the dishwasher is already one of the chores that he's
supposed to do in exchange for his monthly allowance, so if he does that, I can
reload the dishwasher in five or 10 minutes. Score! I could try and make a deal
with him for the vacuuming, but I'm not sure if he'll have time, so I might end
up having to do that one myself.

Finally, the tasks that are not urgent and not important can be ignored. I
know that the humidor task will eventually become urgent when the humidity drops
below 65%, but that probably won't be for a few weeks, and I'll notice the
needle entering the grey at some point, so I can rest comfortably. As for the
looking into hellofresh, meh.

So the Eisenhower Matrix has resulted in a reasonable plan for the day. Let's
take a look at one other framework before I run out of fuel and need to go eat
lunch.

## Action Priority Matrix

This is another 2x2 matrix, but instead of the quadrants being defined by
importance and urgency, they're defined by impact and effort:

![A matrix with four quadrants: high impact and low effort in the top left; high
impact but high effort in the top right; low impact but low effort in the bottom
right; low impact but high effort in the bottom right][matrix4]

Let's do the impact / effort analysis on my task list:
- Github repo: high impact because it lets Ray and I get started on our project,
  and low effort because I just have to click a few buttons.
- Voting info: low impact because I already have a way to vote, but low effort
  because if I open the envelope containing my röstkort ("voting card" in
  Swedish), it probably tells me exactly what to do. Of course, it tells me that
  in Swedish, which is not necessarily low effort for me to read, but I probably
  can get away with just scanning it for an address and date range, so yeah, low
  effort.
- quickblog CLI: low impact because it's basically just making quickblog a
  little more ergonomic to the handful of people that use it, and high effort
  relative to the other tasks on the list.
- Blog post: high impact because it reinforces a habit that I'm trying to build
  and helps me improve as a writer through practice, and high effort relative to
  the other tasks on the list.
- Clean kitchen: low impact because the stupid kitchen will just get dirty
  again, but low effort because unloading and reloading the dishwasher will take
  me max 20 minutes and doesn't require any thinking.
- Vacuum: low impact because the stupid house will just get dirty again, and
  high effort relative to the other tasks on the list.
- hellofresh: low impact because we already have a way to produce and
  subsequently consume suppers, but low effort because I just have to scan a QR
  code and then read some stuff on a website to decide.
- Humidor: low impact because my cigars are already in the recommended humidity
  range, but low effort because it will take me around 10 minutes to find the
  jar of silicon crystals, take the dry ones out of my humidor, and replace them
  with wet ones.

Putting that into the matrix, it looks like this:

![Matrix filled in. high impact, low effort: Github repo; high impact, high
effort: blog post; low impact, low effort: voting info, clean kitchen,
hellofresh, humidor; low impact, high effort: quickblog, vacuum][matrix5]

According to the framework, I should focus on high impact, low effort tasks
("quick wins") as much as I can; consider when / whether to do the high impact,
high effort tasks ("major projects"); drop or delegate low impact, low effort
tasks ("fill-ins") or work on them if and when you have time; and try to avoid
low impact, high effort tasks ("thankless tasks"). If I took this approach, my
day would look like this:
- Create the Github repo
- Consider writing the blog post (assume I considered it and decided to do it,
  since you're now reading it)
- Drop or delegate cleaning the kitchen (delegate to my son FTW!), looking for
  the info on early voting, looking into hellofresh, and changing the crystals
  in my humidor.
- Try to avoid working on quickblog and vacuuming

## Comparison

So my Eisenhower plan looks like this:
1. Github repo
2. Blog post
3. Delegate cleaning the kitchen to my son
4. Suck it up and vacuum
5. Voting info
6. Work on quickblog
7. Ignore hellofresh and the humidor

And my Action Priority Matrix (APM) plan looks like this:
1. Github repo
2. Blog post
3. Delegate cleaning the kitchen to my son
4. Look into voting info and hellofresh and change my humidor crystals if I have
   time
5. Try to avoid working on quickblog and vacuuming

These plans both point to creating the repo first and then writing the blog
post, but then deviate a bit from there. Here's what action I should take on
each task according to the two frameworks looks like:
- Github repo - Eisenhower: do; APM: do.
- Voting info - Eisenhower: schedule; APM: drop or do if there's time.
- quickblog - Eisenhower: schedule; APM: try to avoid.
- Blog post - Eisenhower: do; APM: consider doing.
- Clean up the kitchen - Eisenhower: delegate; APM: delegate.
- Vacuum the apartment - Eisenhower: delegate (or do, if I can't delegate); APM:
  try to avoid.
- hellofresh - Eisenhower: ignore; APM: drop or do if there's time.
- Humidor - Eisenhower: ignore; APM: drop or do if there's time.

These frameworks yield slightly different results, and in fact they are intended
for slightly different contexts. According to the
[mondayblog](https://monday.com/blog/project-management/action-priority-matrix-vs-eisenhower-matri/),
the Eisenhower matrix is most useful for daily tasks (yay!), decision-making,
and activities with deadlines and the Action Priority Matrix is most useful for
business operations, product features, and large initiatives (oops!).

## Summary

The Eisenhower matrix yielded what I consider a pretty reasonable plan for the
day, and one which I intend to implement. In fact, I've already done the first
task, and almost finished the second. I'm going to eat lunch now, after which
I'll suck it up and vacuum, and then if there's time left, I'll open the voting
envelope and then possibly try to finish up the quickblog work. I'll happily
ignore the other two tasks on the list, whatever they were. 😉

I was almost certainly misusing the Action Priority Matrix, but it's interesting
that it pointed to the same two tasks to do first, and I learned about a new
approach to prioritising that I hadn't heard of before. I actually found it when
I was searching for another framework that my previous boss told me about, but
which I only apparently bookmarked in my work account or Slack or something, and
since I don't work there anymore, I can't access that, and can't really remember
enough about the framework to guess at what it's called (it was something like
writing down the stuff you have to do, the stuff you want to do, and ???).

Anyway, off to my peanut butter and jelly sandwich now, ktnxbye.
