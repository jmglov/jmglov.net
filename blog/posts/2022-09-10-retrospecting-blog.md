Description: In which I reflect over a summer of blogging

Back in the beginning of June this year, I left my previous job after six years.
Since I wouldn't start my new job until September 5th, I had a nice long summer
vacation ahead of me! In fact, my vacation even started before my son's (who's
in school) and my wife's (who's a teacher), so I would have some time on my
hands. One of the things I decided to do with this abundance of time was to
start blogging every day.

![A tweet reading: I'm starting a nice long summer vacation today, and I'm going to try a blogging challenge wherein I write and publish something everyday, even if it's a tiny thing. I'm sure there will be some Clojure stuff, some Arsenal stuff, and likely some NixOS stuff as well.](assets/2022-09-10-it-begins.png "And so it begins!" class=border)

Ironically, despite posting this in the morning of June 13th, it wasn't until
noon on June 15th that I posted my first blog entry over on
[Medium](https://medium.com/@jmglov/summertime-and-the-writing-aint-easy-d62c7fa8fdd).
In my defence, I did spend the 13th and 14th feverishly working on chapter 1 of
"[Story of a mediocre
fan](https://7amkickoff.com/index.php/2022/06/16/story-of-a-mediocre-fan/)" for
[my friend Tim's blog](https://7amkickoff.com/), but I have to admit that the
optics aren't great. ðŸ˜‰

The reason for deciding to blog every day, as I intended to explain in [my first
post](https://jmglov.net/blog/2022-06-15-summertime.html) but got sidetracked
(no surprise to people who know me) and ended up talking about tennis, was to
improve my writing. As a kid, I read voraciously, and loved books so much I
decided to start writing them. My first efforts were picture books, which my mom
showed me how to fold and bind with a stapler, but then I moved on to a mystery,
inspired by the Hardy Boys series. As this was a serious novel (according to my
7 year old perspective), I needed a more serious writing tool than a pencil. We
didn't have a computer yet (that would come the following year, and is a story
that I really should write about, if I haven't already (oh yeah, [I kinda did
already](2022-07-22-best-part-of-waking-up.html), though I feel the story would
support a lengthier treatment (haha, I just realised that I put a parenthetical
inside a parenthetical ðŸ˜‚ (what am I, a Lisp programmer?)))), but we did have a
typewriter. This was a real typewriter too, not one of those fancy [IBM
Selectric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Selectric_typewriter) ones. When
you wanted a carriage return, you needed to reach up there and pull a lever (at
least you were rewarded with an incredibly satisfying **ding!**).

I don't remember much about that book other than there was a scary cave chase
scene. I'm not sure if I ever finished it, or even what my definition of
finishing it would have been back then. I do remember that I started writing a
Tolkien-inspired book about elves and such at some point, but I'm sure I didn't
get very far with that. I wrote a few chapters of a spy thriller starring
characters called The Sniper and The Assassin. I did a bunch of writing in high
school, as you do, and then did even more in university, and then pretty much
stopped. I did write stuff at work, of course, but it's mostly emails and
technical documents, which is a very different sort of writing indeed.

I'm not one of those people who just knows that I have a great novel in me, and
by golly I'll write it one of these days, but I am someone who enjoys writing
and misses not doing much of it. So when a summer with no work unfurled before
me, I decided I was going to seize the day and get to writing: one blog post a
day for the rest of the summer.

In the 88 days since I made that decision, I've written 57 posts (including this
one). If I saw my goal as writing one post a day, every single day, I would have
to conclude that I failed to reach that goal. However, the real goal was to get
better at writing through frequent practice, and the act of writing one post a
day was simply the process by which I planned to accomplish this. As with any
process, the point is not to follow it to the letter, the point is that the
process is supposed to enable you to make progress towards whatever your goal
is.

Speaking of process, a vital part of any good process is time to reflect, which
is formalised in many software methodologies as a periodic meeting called a
retrospective. In the retrospective, the team discusses how things have been
going and what could be improved. This concept is useful even in individual
work, and in fact in individual work, we often don't allocate sufficient time
for reflection, which can greatly harm our ability to learn from our mistakes
and our successes.

This post is a retrospective of my summer of blogging.

What went well?
- 57 posts in 88 days is a post on two out of every three days, on average.
- People were actually reading my posts! ðŸ˜² In fact, I had three posts with more
  than 10,000 views (more on that in a moment).
- I had a good time writing most of the posts.
- I feel like I am a better writer than when I started.

What could be improved?
- If writing every day is vital, I need to get better at coming up with a topic
  when nothing comes immediately to mind
- Too many words, Mr. Mozart. I could do a better job of getting to the point
  and removing all of the stuff that isn't crucial to getting across the message
  or telling the story.

What did I learn?
- Writing is really time consuming! Even though I didn't do much editing (for
  most posts, I read them through once just to ensure that I didn't have any
  grammatical errors or parts that didn't make much sense, but didn't really
  work on the structure of the post), even the shortest posts took about 30
  minutes, and some of them took four or five hours! The "Story of a mediocre
  fan" series that I posted over on 7amkickoff (chapters
  [1](https://7amkickoff.com/index.php/2022/06/16/story-of-a-mediocre-fan/),
  [2](https://7amkickoff.com/index.php/2022/06/23/story-of-a-mediocre-fan-chapter-2/),
  [3](https://7amkickoff.com/index.php/2022/06/30/story-of-a-mediocre-fan-chapter-3/),
  and
  [4](https://7amkickoff.com/index.php/2022/07/09/story-of-a-mediocre-fan-chapter-4/))
  took about 10 hours **per chapter**.
- Writing is a habit, and if you want to write every day, a routine is really
  important. In the spirit of [doing the most important thing
  first](2022-08-27-most-important-first.html), a good routine for me would be
  setting aside an hour before breakfast, every single day. In fact, that's
  what I've done the past few days to write this post. (The reason this short
  post has taken multiple days to write is because I needed to do some data
  analysis to get the statistics that I'm about to share.)

I'll wrap up this retrospective with some statistics. Here are the 10 most
popular posts from the summer:
- [Dogfooding Blambda 4: CLI, CLIier,

I suspect the "Story of a mediocre fan" series got even more views, since they
were posted on a very widely read Arsenal blog, but I don't want to bother Tim
to get those stats, since the point of all of this wasn't page views. ðŸ˜‰

Now that this experiment is over, I've concluded that I like blogging, and it's
something that I want to continue. I won't set a regular schedule for posting,
but rather set aside time for writing (and hacking on
[quickblog](https://github.com/borkdude/quickblog) and
[Blambda](https://github.com/jmglov/blambda) and the stuff that I often write
about) and post when I have something interesting (to me) to post. I also want
to try writing some more focused pieces, which I'll edit and get feedback from
people and so on. We'll see how it goes! ðŸ™‚
