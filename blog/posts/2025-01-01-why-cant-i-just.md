I'm not one for New Year's resolutions, so instead I'll simply ask myself some
questions.

Why can't I just
- go to the gym three times a week?
- get 10,000 steps a day even without Rover pulling me along?
- go for a nice long run at least once a week, even if there's snow on the
  ground?
- write something in my blog every morning, even if it's just a series of random
  thoughts or a bawdy limerick of my own composition?
- write anything in my blog that's fewer than 10,000 words? ðŸ™„
- finish my draft of the [Heart of Clojure conference
  report](https://jmglov.net/blog/draft-heart-of-clojure-2024.html)?
- record Season 1 of [Politechs](https://politechspod.com/) with Ray?
- finish writing my [oTranscribe](https://otranscribe.com/) clone with Scittle?
- take part 2 of the amazing [Nand to Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)
  course?
- read more of "CrepÃºsculo: Un amor peligroso"?
- OMG finally stop eating cheese already?

The answer to all of these questions is basically "you can just, so why not
just?"

Happy New Year! ðŸŽ‰
