As I was interviewing for a new job last month, I encountered something
completely new to me in the European startup scene: founders thinking their
company is Netflix. Engineers thinking their company is Netflix is nothing new,
of course. There have been a [myriad of blog
posts](https://programmerfriend.com/not-google/) on this phenomenon, focusing on
the tendency to overengineer and design for a scale that not only do you not
have, you will never have (for example, your API is servicing thousands of
requests **per day**, but you design for thousands of requests per second).

This is not what I want to talk about in this post. What I want to talk about is
something more harmful than overengineering: the spread of Netflix culture.

Back in 2014, Netflix's Chief Talent Officer, Patty McCord, wrote an article in
the Harvard Business Review entitled "[How Netflix Reinvented
HR](https://hbr.org/2014/01/how-netflix-reinvented-hr)"
([permalink](https://web.archive.org/web/20230601142612/https://hbr.org/2014/01/how-netflix-reinvented-hr)),
following on from a slide deck published by Netflix CEO Reed Hastings called
"[Netflix Culture: Freedom &
Responsibility](https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664)"
([permalink](https://web.archive.org/web/20240226210542/https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664)).
The slide deck explained the "seven aspects of Netflix culture":
- Values are what we value
- High Performance
- Freedom & Responsibility
- Context, not Control
- Highly Aligned, Loosely Coupled
- Pay Top of Market
- Promotions & Development

The Netflix culture as presented here basically boils down to "we hire and
retain only top performers and trust them to create great products by creating
alignment around a shared vision, rewarding those people with great compensation
and the opportunity to develop their career." Sounds great, right?
