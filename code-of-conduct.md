# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

A primary goal of this blog is to be inclusive to the largest number of
participants, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, I
am committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic
status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in
the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of
us and the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct outlines my expectations for all those who participate in
discussions about my blog, as well as the consequences for unacceptable
behavior.

I invite all those who participate here to help me create safe and positive
experiences for everyone.

## Creating a Welcoming and Inclusive Culture

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is
essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that
exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is
welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the
fullest extent, please recognize their efforts.

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

* Be friendly and patient.
* Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of
  all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members
  of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status,
  social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender
  identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion,
  and mental and physical ability.
* Be considerate. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be
  communicating in someone else's primary language.
* Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no
  excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some
  frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
  personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel
  uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Readers of this blog
  should be respectful when dealing with each other as well as with people
  who do not read this blog.
* Be careful in the words that you choose. Be kind to others. Do not insult or
  put down other people. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't
  acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
  * Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  * Discriminatory jokes and language.
  * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  * Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying
    information ("doxing").
  * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  * Unwelcome sexual attention.
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then
    stop.
* When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and
  technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements
  and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. Different
  people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why
  someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that
  it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead,
  focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
* I reserve the right to delete excessive self-promotional or commercial posts.
* Content that has been identified as objectionable, inappropriate, or off-topic
  will be subject to deletion by me. Posters will receive a warning and risk
  being blocked from this discussion forum if unacceptable behavior persists.

These decisions are made by me, Josh Glover, in my sole discretion. 

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from anyone, including myself, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a commenter engages in unacceptable behavior, I may take any action deemed
appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from
this discussion forum without warning.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other
concerns, please notify me as soon as possible by emailing jmglov@gmail.com or
pinging me at @jmglov on Clojurians Slack.

## Addressing Issues

Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be changed. To discuss a decision,
contact me at jmglov@gmail.com and I will review your question.
