            <h2>Info for Recruiters</h2>
            <p>
                I'm just about to start a new job, and am not interested in
                anything new at the moment. Do feel free to contact me in future
                if you have an engineering leadership opportunity in a great
                company that is committed to an inclusive working environment. I
                am interested in socially conscious companies looking to make a
                positive difference in the world, especially in the alternative
                energy sector and other areas seeking to mitigate climate change
                and promote social justice. I am not interested in working in
                the gambling or defence industries.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have 20 years of professional experience, and a special
                interest in functional programming languages like Clojure,
                Racket, Elixir, Erlang, OCaml, and Haskell, and cloud
                technologies like AWS. You can find more details on my LinkedIn
                profile, above.

                    <h2>Learning Clojure</h2>
                    <p>
                        Clojure is a Lisp that runs on the Java Virtual Machine, and a really
                        fun programming language to boot. I've run a few workshops on learning
                        Clojure, using <a href="https://www.maria.cloud/">Maria</a>, an online
                        coding environment for beginners.

                        <p>
                            Learning functional programming for programmers without previous
                            functional or Clojure experience.
