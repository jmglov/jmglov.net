    <h2>Info for Recruiters</h2>
    <p>
      I've recently started a new job, and am not interested in a change at the
      moment. Do feel free to contact me in future if you have opportunities to
      work on a high-performing team which is passionate about functional
      programming in languages like Clojure, Racket, Elixir, Erlang, OCaml,
      and Haskell, and works with technologies like Amazon Web Services, Datomic,
      Onyx, and Kafka.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am interested in socially conscious companies looking to make a positive
      difference in the world, especially in the alternative energy sector. I am
      not interested in working in the gambling or defence industries.
