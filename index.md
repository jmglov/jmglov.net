## Info for Recruiters

I'm just about to start a new job, and am not interested in anything new at the
moment. Do feel free to contact me in future if you have an engineering
leadership opportunity in a great company that is committed to an inclusive
working environment. I am interested in socially conscious companies looking to
make a positive difference in the world, especially in the alternative energy
sector and other areas seeking to mitigate climate change and promote social
justice. I am not interested in working in the gambling or defence industries.

I have 20 years of professional experience, and a special interest in functional
programming languages like Clojure, Racket, Elixir, Erlang, OCaml, and Haskell,
and cloud technologies like AWS. You can find more details on my LinkedIn
profile, above.

## Blog

OMG I have a [blog](blog/)!

## Learning Clojure

Clojure is a Lisp that runs on the Java Virtual Machine, and a really fun
programming language to boot. I've run a few workshops on learning Clojure,
using [Maria](https://www.maria.cloud/), an online coding environment for
beginners.

- [Functional Programming with Clojure](teaching/clojure/fpwc/): Learning
  functional programming for programmers without previous functional or Clojure
  experience.
- [Clojure for Functional Programmers](teaching/clojure/fpwc/): Learning Clojure
  for programmers with previous functional experience.
